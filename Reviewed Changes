# package org.junit does not exist has been an error message that has blocked me from progressing to work on this assignment Until I was allowed to write the codes though I can't really run them to get the output.
 Over all, I have done almost the whole assignment, Including writting the tests and the bugs they are meant to expose. I have also included the java docs, removing t he messy comments that were initilly in the codes to remind me of the bugs.
