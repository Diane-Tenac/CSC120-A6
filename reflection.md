What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I have most of the methods now not working but I am choosing to submit it though it's half way, I've been having package related error messages yet I have imported them in. I haven't figured out any bug yet, but I believe after having that error fixed, I will be able to make functions that will expose the bugs. I can theoretically state some like some of exceptions incase the computer is being removed from an empty inventory, not having the OS etc. I am hopping to finish this as soon as I get the error fixed.
